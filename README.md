The first 5k target playlists (from playlist_id=7 to playlist_id=50431) are sequential. For each of these playlists, the order of tracks in train.csv corresponds to the order inside the playlist.
The last 5k target playlists (from playlist_id=3 to playlist_id=50424) are random. For each of these playlists, the order of tracks in train.csv is random and does not generally corresponds to the order inside the playlist. The same is for all other playlists in train.csv.
